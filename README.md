# Job Search Resources
I "luckily" secured an offer right before I graduated from Flatiron School in 2021. To me, "luck" is a combination of hard work and opportunity. You can read [how I landed my first tech offer on Medium](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-i-landed-my-offer-tips-for-bootcamp-students-675a6d8096e9).

I don't think most coding bootcamps do a good job of conveying the message that the tech industry is **VERY** competitive. More often than not, I see most bootcamp graduates have trouble securing a position after graduating because they don't know how to search for a tech job. From my experience, interviewing for a tech position is quite different from the other roles I've interviewed for (server, sales associate, bank teller, mortgage loan processor, legal analyst, editor, etc.).
