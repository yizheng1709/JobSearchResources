# Job Search Resources

Hi! I'm Eva (ee-vah) and I am a bootcamp grad.

I "luckily" secured an offer right before I graduated from Flatiron School in 2021. To me, "luck" is a combination of hard work and opportunity. You can read [how I landed my first tech offer on Medium](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-i-landed-my-offer-tips-for-bootcamp-students-675a6d8096e9).

I don't think most coding bootcamps do a good job of conveying the message that the tech industry is **VERY** competitive. I see many bootcamp graduates have trouble securing a position after graduating. From my experience, interviewing for a tech position is quite different from the other roles I've interviewed for (server, sales associate, bank teller, mortgage loan processor, legal analyst, editor, etc.). 

Software engineering positions often have a few rounds of interviews and the rounds increase as you advance in your career. 

The rounds usually consist of:
- Phone screening with a recruiter
  - Be prepared:
    - To walk through your resume
    - To answer why you are applying to the company
- Coding assessment
  - Could be a take-home assignment, online assessment, or pair programming with an engineer on the team
- Meeting the hiring manager (a mix of technical and behavioral questions)
  - Depending on the company, you might meet more of the team
- System design with a senior engineer or hiring manager (usually for more senior positions)

Software engineering interviews are tough and a stamina test. But you know what? The tech community has each other's backs, and the web is overflowing with resources to help us nail that next gig! I'll admit, I was (and still am, honestly) in need of some serious guidance when I first dove in. So, I'm paying it forward by putting together this list of resources. 

## Resume / LinkedIn
- [Rezi - Build Your Resume with AI](https://www.rezi.ai/)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
  - I believe that LinkedIn is a powerful platform that helps with networking and finding your next opportunity. To help your posts/profile stand out, I recommend using graphics. Canva makes it super easy to bootstrap your LinkedIn banner/posts.
